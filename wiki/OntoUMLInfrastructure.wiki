==OntoUML Infrastructure==

OLED uses an infrastructure which was former developed by Roberto Carrareto, latter enhanced by Antognoni Albuquerque and now constantly improved by us. This means that you can sort of "integrate" your project with OLED using this infrastructure to create your models.

To use the infrastruture you will need of the following library: 

  * br.ufes.inf.nemo.ontouml_1.0.0.201409231111.jar (_located at trunk/br.ufes.inf.nemo.common/lib/refontouml/_)

----
*Loading and Saving an OntoUML model*
----

{{{
RefOntoUMLResourceUtil.loadModel(refontoumlpath);
// where refontoumlpath is a absolute file path for the model artifact with extension *.refontouml
}}}

{{{
RefOntoUMLResourceUtil.saveModel(refontoumlpath, root);
//where root is the root RefOntoUML.Package of the model
}}}

----
*Importing an OntoUML model into OLED*
----

  # Go to: File -> Import -> Ecore Instance (based on Reference Metamodel)
  # Choose the refontouml file and press Ok.
