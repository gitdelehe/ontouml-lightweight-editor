*INFRASTRUCTURE*
----

OLED uses an infrastructure former developed by Roberto Carrareto, latter enhanced by Antognoni Albuquerque and now constantly improved by us. This means that you can sort of "integrate" your project with OLED using this infrastructure. 

The tool allows you to import and export the content of your model and rules through files:

i) the content of your model through XMI files (renamed to *.refontouml), and
ii) the rules (axioms) through OCL files with extension *.ocl.

Our infrastructure is nowadays comprised only by an Ecore-based OntoUML metamodel. You can then create, load and use OntoUML models dynamically (via code) through this metamodel. 

Our infrastructure is available as Java API libraries. 


 that Reference Ecore-based OntoUML metamodel (we renamed these XMI files to extensions *.refontouml).

Therefore, developing a transformation to our OntoUML infrastructure.
