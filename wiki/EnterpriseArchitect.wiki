In this wiki we explain how you can install, access and use the OntoUML modeling language in the Enterprise Architect (EA) version 10.

OLED support models designed in the Enterprise Architect i.e. you can import models designed with EA into the OLED tool. First, we explain how to install, access and use OntoUML in the Enterprise Architect and latter explain how you can export your EA model to benefit from all our tool capabilities such as simulation and model checking, semantic anti-patterns identification, transformations to OWL, SBVR and so on.

*Installing...*

Step-by-step:

  * Delete any version that you might have of the OntoUML MDG Technology and the OntoUML Template: exclude the older XML files and replace them to the new XML files in the following folders:
